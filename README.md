# Masterarbeit_Codes
Scripts (Python / C++) for the master thesis at OSU - Center for Automotive Research

### **Topic: A learning-based Ranking Method of 3D Point Cloud Registration Algorithms for Vehicle Self-localization

Timeframe: 04/01/2023 to 04/12/2023


### **Content**

[ ] "Baseline studies": Evaluate state-of-the art algorithms (P2Point-ICP, P2Plan-ICP, P2Dist-NDT) on the Moriyama open-source Autoware dataset

[ ] "Evaluations": Obtain Ground Truth labels for supervised training of a neural network with own collected data

[ ] "Processing_Pipeline": Implementation of the three presented approaches (MLP for regression; Pointnet2 + MLP for regression and ResNet18 for classification) and model validation
