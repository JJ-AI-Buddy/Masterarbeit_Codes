How to evaluate own dataset to obtain the error metrics for training a machine learning model for ranking different point cloud registration algorithms

Hint: It is recommended to use Spyder as IDE because there are some changes to be made to the scripts before running them

### 00_Mapping_OwnData ###
Is used to build point cloud maps of LiDAR scans and odometry data from a L4-capable vehicle

### 01_OwnData_Preprocess ###
Is used to preprocess the point clouds and fasten up the evaluation script by already using preprocessed files as input


### 02_OwnData_EvalPerformance ###
Is used to get the error metrics of the registration algorithms that will later be used as labels for training a machine learning model
Only contains the P2Point and P2Plane ICP algorithm

### 03_OwnData_Visualize_Modified ###
Is optional; but will give some qualitative insights



----- NDT ---


- Set the inputs for the whole NDT evaluation process in the txt-file:
	CPPScripts_New/Build/Release/Parameters_NDT_Reg.txt
- The loop in the source cpp script does not work, so only the first row of the txt-file will be used in each run;
- After running the program copy the first row of the txt-file and paste it to:
	CPPScripts_New/Build/Release/Parameters_NDT_Reg_Executed.txt
- Then delete the first row before starting the program again

- Run the program by double click on:
	CPPScripts_New/Build/Release/ndt_reg_ownData.exe

- Hint: OpenNI2.dll file must be in the same directory for the C++ program to work

- Make changes to inputs in source file if necessary
	CPPScripts_New/Src/NDT_Registration_Eval_ownData_NEW.cpp
